.SH DESCRIPTION
NBTscan is a program for scanning IP networks for NetBIOS name information. It sends NetBIOS status query to each
address in supplied range and lists received information in human readable form. For each responded host it lists IP
address, NetBIOS computer name, logged-in user name and MAC address (such as Ethernet).
.PP
NBTscan produces a report like that:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    IP address       NetBIOS Name     Server    User             MAC address
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    192.168.1.2      MYCOMPUTER                 JDOE             00-a0-c9-12-34-56

First column lists IP address of responded host. Second column is computer name. Third column indicates if this computer
shares or is able to share files or printers. For NT machine it means that Server Service is running on this computer.
For Windows 95 it means that "I want to be able to give others access to my files" or "I want to be able to allow others
to print on my \fBprinter\fP(s)" checkbox is ticked (in Control Panel/Network/File and Print Sharing). Most often it means that
this computer shares files. Third column shows user name. If no one is logged on from this computer it is same as computer
name. Last column shows adapter MAC address.
.PP
If run with \fB-v\fP switch NBTscan lists whole NetBIOS name table for each responded address. The output looks like that:

.SH OPTIONS
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B
\fB-v\fP
Verbose output. Print all names received from each host.
.TP
.B
\fB-d\fP
Dump packets. Print whole packet contents. Cannot be used with \fB-v\fP, \fB-s\fP or \fB-h\fP options.
.TP
.B
\fB-e\fP
Format output in /etc/hosts format.
.TP
.B
\fB-l\fP
Format output in lmhosts format.
.TP
.B
\fB-t\fP <\fItimeout\fP>
Wait \fItimeout\fP seconds for response. Default 1.
.TP
.B
\fB-b\fP <\fIbandwidth\fP>
Output  throttling. Slow down output so that it uses no more that \fIbandwidth\fP bps. Useful on slow links, so
that outgoing queries don't get dropped.
.TP
.B
\fB-r\fP
Use local port 137 for scans. Win95 boxes respond to this only. You need to be root to use this option.
.TP
.B
\fB-q\fP
Suppress banners and error messages.
.TP
.B
\fB-s\fP <\fIseparator\fP>
Script-friendly output. Don't print column and record headers, separate fields with \fIseparator\fP.
.TP
.B
\fB-h\fP
Print human-readable names for services. Can only be used with \fB-v\fP option.
.TP
.B
\fB-m\fP <\fIretransmits\fP>
Number of \fIretransmits\fP. Default 0.
.TP
.B
\fB-f\fP <\fIfilename\fP>
Take IP addresses to scan from file "\fIfilename\fP"
.TP
.B
\fItarget\fP
NBTscan is a command-line tool. You have to supply at least one argument, the address range, in one of
three forms:
.RS
.TP
.B
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
Single IP in dotted-decimal notation. Example: 192.168.1.1
.TP
.B
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx
Net address and subnet mask. Example: 192.168.1.0/24
.TP
.B
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx-xxx
Address range. Example: 192.168.1.1-127. This will scan all addresses from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.127
.SH EXAMPLES
Scans the whole C-class network:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    nbtscan -r 192.168.1.0/24

.fam T
.fi
Scans a range from 192.168.1.25 to 192.168.1.137:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    nbtscan 192.168.1.25-137

.fam T
.fi
Scans C-class network. Prints results in script-friendly format using colon as field \fIseparator\fP:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    nbtscan -v -s : 192.168.1.0/24

.fam T
.fi
The last command produces output like that:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    192.168.0.1:NT_SERVER:00U
    192.168.0.1:MY_DOMAIN:00G
    192.168.0.1:ADMINISTRATOR:03U
    192.168.0.2:OTHER_BOX:00U
    \.\.\.

.fam T
.fi
Scans IP addresses specified in file iplist:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    nbtscan -f iplist

.SH NETBIOS SUFFIXES
NetBIOS Suffix, aka NetBIOS End Character (endchar), indicates service type for the registered name. The most known
codes are listed below. (U = Unique Name, G = Group Name)

.SH FAQ
.IP 1. 4
NBTscan lists my Windows boxes just fine but does not list my Unixes or routers. Why?
.PP
R: That is the way it is supposed to work. NBTscan uses NetBIOS for scanning and NetBIOS is only implemented by Windows
(and some software on Unix such as Samba).
.IP 2. 4
Why do I get "Connection reset by peer" errors on Windows 2000?
.PP
R: NBTscan uses port 137 UDP for sending queries. If the port is closed on destination host destination will reply with
ICMP "Port unreachable" message. Most operating system will ignore this message. Windows 2000 reports it to the application
as "Connection reset by peer" error. Just ignore it.
.IP 3. 4
Why NBTscan doesn't scan for shares? Are you going to add share scanning to NBTscan?
.PP
R: No. NBTscan uses UDP for what it does. That makes it very fast. Share scanning requires TCP. For one thing, it will
make \fBnbtscan\fP more slow. Also adding share scanning means adding a lot of new code to \fBnbtscan\fP. There is a lot of good share
scanners around, so there is no reason to duplicate that work.
.IP 4. 4
Why do I get 00-00-00-00-00-00 instead of MAC address when I scan a Samba box?
.PP
R: Because that's what Samba send in response to the query. Nbtscan just prints out what it gets.
